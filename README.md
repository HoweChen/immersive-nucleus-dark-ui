# Immersive-Nucleus Dark UI

Nucleus is an adaptable UI theme for Atom with your favorite syntax coloring at its core! This gives the UI a coherent feel, with whatever syntax theme you like to use.

## Statement

This is a fork of Nuclues Dark UI, I just change some variables of the style and make it immersive just like the design of Material UI

## Installation

Inside atom go to settings, select Install and search for Nucleus.

Or install directly from the console:

`apm install immersive-nucleus-dark-ui`

## Requirements

Every color used in the UI is taken directly from a (dark) syntax theme. In order for this to work, the syntax theme needs to have a `syntax-variables.less`. A light version of this theme is still being worked on.

## Features

- Clutterless new windows with a flat background. ![Atom Dark Fusion](http://i.imgur.com/UOAuMpg.png)

- A minimal approach by using only three colors in the background of the theme. All colors used are mixed variations on colors from the syntax theme. ![Gruvbox Plus](http://i.imgur.com/SkwaV9x.png)

- Floating modal overlays (Command Palette, Fuzzy Finder etc) with a nice big type, strongly inspired by Spotlight on OS X. ![Gruvbox Plus](http://i.imgur.com/inUen2W.png)

- Consistent design over different packages. File an issue if you think a package you're using needs some tweaking. ![Firewatch](http://i.imgur.com/O3cdoGH.png)
