# Immersive Nucleus Dark UI â€“ Deprecated

Nucleus is an adaptable UI theme for Atom with your favorite syntax coloring at its core! This gives the UI a coherent feel, with whatever syntax theme you like to use.

## Statement

This is a fork of Nuclues Dark UI, I just change some variables of the style and make it immersive just like the design of Material UI
